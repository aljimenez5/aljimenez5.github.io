# *The budding interest*
I joined the technology startup field in an office operations capacity right after graduate school. As Office Coordinator, I actively interacted with everyone in the company and it gave me perspective in how each department functions. The more I got to understand the different capacities that make the company work, I was able to make a judgment about my own career line. It was new to me because I always knew what I was passionate about but never at what capacity that could enable me to address local and global issues. I see all the great things that technology software does for sectors like education in helping accelerate/individualize learning at all grade levels. 

# *Where I started...*
I started off by learning Python through online courses and other online resources. It was an interesting start because there were learning curves that required me to mentally push past. The amount of times that I thought about quitting because a concept was not clicking in my mind and it was very frustrating. After making it to the other side of the threshold, it was the most satisfying feeling ever. I knew more and understood better than before and I would've never had the opportunity to get that feeling if I would've just stopped. This is where I learned how important perservarence is when learning within a field that I have had no previous experience/knowledge in. 
# *The choice it led me toâ€¦*
This all has led me to want to start my own startup in the future where I can build my own platform where data can be used to provide ethical policy recommendations in all sectors. My goal has switched into the direction of programming to gain hands-on experience and continue to explore my interests in leveraging technology in providing high impact solutions to high-need fields. I joined Flatiron School to build upon these interests and jumpstart my career in tech.
