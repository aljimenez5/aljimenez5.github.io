Choosing a topic was a bit of a challenge for me, not because I didn't have any ideas but because I wanted to choose something I know others can use. As idealistic as it sounded, I stopped overreaching and decided to scrape GameStop for upcoming video games. 

Video games are great but you know what's greater? Not having to google upcoming video games and clicking through multiple links before finding an actual list. That's where this CLI comes in! So you don't have to do the fishing, I went out and did the fishing!

One of the biggest challenges (which to my surprise was NOT being stuck on what to code) was actually getting the code to do something! I had a bunch of methods, I knew what I wanted each one to do, and each one knew what it was meant to do but they were not collaborating at any point. 

It wasn't until I was on a Project Support Session with a Technical Coach and they said, "Where are you calling this method?" My ~~instance~~ instant response was "oooohhhhhhh". At that point we ran out of time before we could work past that but just those few words turned my entire code base around. 

I was so accustomed to doing the labs where I never had to worry about what goes into the method's paramaters or how they make it into the parameters because the labs already had that included for me. This project helped bring it all together by breaking the code and fixing it then breaking it again to fixing it to get to the final product.

I enjoyed fishing and swimming with the sharks (fishes and sharks: my new coding metaphors) as I spent my time in the deep end with the proper teachings of Flatiron.
